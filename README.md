### Date: May 5, 2024 (initial update) ###
#### Current Features ####
- Cluster set up in MongoDB
- Schema for Ingredient objects that includes the ingredient name and weight per cup in grams
- Create and Get functionality for ingredient collection in MongoDB
#### Issues Encountered ####
- Update for ingredient collection is not yet working as expected. There is an error that says that findById is not a valid function for Ingredient.
#### Lessons Learned ####
- MongoDB and json documents are new to me, so I have been learning a lot about how they function.
