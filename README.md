#### New Features ####
- Ingredients and densities (weight per cup) added to database
#### Issues Encountered ####
- Ingredients can be written out differently or go by different names, so I need to think about how to manage my data so it can be used effectively for recipe conversions.
- Time management in general has been an issue the past couple weeks. It was midterms and it has been easy to get pulled to work that feels more urgent.
#### Lessons Learned ####
- Right now I have questions that I think will turn into lessons soon. For example, I decided to use only grams per cup in the database to keep the data manageable, and I think that will work well for conversions to other units, but I have yet to see how that will actually work out in practice.


### Date: May 5, 2024 (initial update) ###
#### Current Features ####
- Cluster set up in MongoDB
- Schema for Ingredient objects that includes the ingredient name and weight per cup in grams
- Create and Get functionality for ingredient collection in MongoDB
#### Issues Encountered ####
- Update for ingredient collection is not yet working as expected. There is an error that says that findById is not a valid function for Ingredient.
#### Lessons Learned ####
- MongoDB and json documents are new to me, so I have been learning a lot about how they function.
